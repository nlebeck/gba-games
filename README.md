# gba-games

I'm teaching myself to program for the Game Boy Advance using the tutorial Tonc
(http://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm). This repository holds code that
I write as I follow the tutorial and experiment with GBA programming.

The directory "learning-gba" holds code I wrote while following TONC, playing
around with the concepts introduced in the tutorials.

The directory "template-project" provides a template project that compiles using
devkitARM and links to tonclib.
